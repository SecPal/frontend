# Preflight PR Size Check - Excluded Files

# ==========================================

# Files matching these patterns are excluded from the 600-line PR size check.

# Each line is a grep-compatible regex pattern.

#

# Why exclude these files?

# - Lock files are auto-generated and can be very large

# - License files are boilerplate and not meaningful code changes

#

# This file should match the exclusions in:

# .github/workflows/reusable-pr-size.yml

# Dependency lock files (auto-generated)

package-lock.json
composer.lock
yarn.lock
pnpm-lock.yaml

# License files (boilerplate)
