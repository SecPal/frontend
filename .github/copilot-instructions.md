# Frontend Repository Instructions

These instructions are self-contained for the `frontend` repository at runtime.
Do not assume instructions from sibling repositories or comment-based inheritance are loaded.

## Always-On Rules

- Run `git status --short --branch` before any write action. New work must
  start from a clean, up-to-date local `main`: switch to `main`, pull with
  fast-forward only, verify a clean state, then create the dedicated topic
  branch. Never start implementation on local `main`, and stop if a dirty
  non-`main` branch contains unrelated work.
- TDD is mandatory. Write or update the smallest relevant failing test FIRST, then implement, then refactor with tests green.
- Quality first. Do not trade correctness, review depth, validation depth, or issue tracking for speed.
- Keep one topic per change. 1 topic = 1 PR = 1 branch. Do not mix unrelated fixes,
  features, refactors, docs, or governance cleanup.
- Never use bypasses such as `--no-verify` or force-push.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` in the same change set for real fixes, features, and breaking changes.
- Create a GitHub issue immediately for every real out-of-scope bug, technical debt, missing test,
  documentation gap, warning, audit finding, or deprecation you cannot fix now. Do not leave untracked
  `TODO`, `FIXME`, or follow-up work.
- Use EPIC plus sub-issues before implementation whenever work will span more than one PR; if in doubt,
  choose EPIC plus sub-issues.
- Keep GitHub-facing communication in English and reference files and lines instead of pasting large code blocks.
- Treat warnings, audit findings, and deprecations as actionable. Fix them in scope or track them immediately.
- Never reply to Copilot review comments with GitHub comment tools. Fix the code, push,
  and resolve threads through the approved non-comment workflow.
- Keep `SPDX-FileCopyrightText` years current in edited files or companion `.license` sidecars.
- Domain policy is strict: `secpal.app` for the public homepage and real email addresses,
  `apk.secpal.app` for the canonical Android artifact and release-metadata host,
  `api.secpal.dev` for the API, `app.secpal.dev` for the PWA/frontend, `secpal.dev` for dev,
  staging, testing, and examples, and `app.secpal` only as the Android application identifier.
- After every merge, immediately return the local repo to a ready state:
  switch to `main`, pull with fast-forward only, delete the merged topic
  branch, prune remotes, refresh Node dependencies with `npm ci` where
  applicable, run `npm run build` when available, and confirm the working tree
  is clean.

## Design Principles

- DRY: eliminate duplicated logic and repeated UI or policy handling before it drifts.
- KISS: prefer the simplest solution that satisfies the current requirement and remains easy to maintain.
- YAGNI: implement only what the current issue or acceptance criteria require;
  track future ideas as issues instead of building them now.
- SOLID: keep responsibilities narrow, interfaces small, and extension points explicit.
- Fail fast: validate early, stop on the first failed check, and do not accumulate known breakage.

## Issue And PR Discipline

- Every real out-of-scope finding becomes a GitHub issue immediately; no untracked follow-up work is allowed.
- Complex work uses EPIC plus sub-issues before implementation. PRs should close
  sub-issues, not the epic, until the final linked step.
- When local review finds zero issues, commit and push the finished branch before opening any PR.
- The first PR state must be draft. Do not open a normal PR first.
- Mark a draft PR ready only after the final self-review in the PR view still finds zero issues.
- When creating or editing PRs programmatically, write multi-line body content to a file and use
  `--body-file` to prevent shell escaping issues.

## Required Validation

Before any commit, PR, or merge, announce the checklist you are executing and stop on the first failed item.
At minimum verify:

- the active branch and PR scope still address exactly one topic
- TDD happened: the relevant test failed first and now passes
- the smallest relevant validation for the touched area passed: tests, typecheck, and lint when applicable
- out-of-scope findings were turned into GitHub issues immediately
- `CHANGELOG.md` was updated for real changes
- commits are GPG-signed
- REUSE compliance was checked when changed files require it
- when a fix alters observable behavior, state lifecycle, error handling, or security constraints,
  the corresponding tests were identified and updated in the same commit
- before pushing changes that alter observable behavior, state lifecycle, error handling, or security constraints,
  affected tests were run locally (`PREFLIGHT_RUN_TESTS=1 git push` or invoke the test runner directly)
- the local 4-pass review was completed, including DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID,
  quality-first, and issue-management checks
- no bypass was used

## Repository Conventions

- Stack: Node 22, React, TypeScript strict mode, Vite, Vitest, and React Testing Library.
- All API types come from generated OpenAPI types in `@/types/api`; do not hand-write response types.
- Keep presentation in components and reusable logic in hooks or API clients.
- Prefer functional components, named exports, and existing design-system patterns before new abstractions.
- Preserve strict TypeScript, accessibility, semantic HTML, focus behavior, and responsive layouts.

## Scope Notes

- Do not add dependencies or create documentation files unless the task requires them.
