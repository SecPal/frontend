# Frontend Runtime Overlay

This file auto-applies to all files in this repo so strict SecPal governance stays always present at runtime.

- `AGENTS.md` is the authoritative runtime baseline for this repo.
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is only a compatibility mirror.
- Non-negotiable: TDD first, quality first, 1 topic = 1 PR = 1 branch,
  immediate GitHub issue creation for every real out-of-scope finding, and no
  bypass.
- If work needs more than one PR, or probably will, create an EPIC with linked
  sub-issues before implementation.
- Design discipline is always-on: DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID, and fail fast.
- GitHub communication stays in English and uses file and line references instead of large verbatim code quotes.
- Do not add AI self-references, generated-by text, tool promotion, or AI
  attribution unless the task explicitly requires documenting AI tooling.
- Keep changes repo-local, minimal, and consistent with React, strict TypeScript, and generated API type conventions.
- Apply the SecPal domain policy and immediate warning and issue triage rules from the repo baseline.
- Apply the baseline licensing and REUSE rules. Use `AGPL-3.0-or-later` for
  SecPal-owned material intentionally covered by the AGPL. Never add or restore
  `LicenseRef-SecPal-Attribution` after the licensing rollout. Preserve
  deliberately different licenses and third-party metadata, use
  `SecPal Contributors` where the project convention applies, retain and extend
  first-publication years when required, and run relevant license validation
  after metadata changes.
- Preserve `Powered by SecPal – A guard's best friend` on official user-facing
  SecPal surfaces where intentionally present. Licensing work must not weaken
  or make this branding optional, add `Based on SecPal` guidance, or introduce
  white-label or fork-branding configuration.
