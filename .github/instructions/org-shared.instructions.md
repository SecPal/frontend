# Frontend Runtime Overlay

Use this file only when a task needs additional repo-wide governance context beyond `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is the authoritative runtime baseline for this repo.
- Keep changes repo-local, minimal, and consistent with React, strict TypeScript, and generated API type conventions.
- Apply the SecPal domain policy and immediate warning and issue triage rules from the repo baseline.
